# CIND-820-Project
Repository for  CIND820 Research Project
Repository Content:
Descriptive Code - dividing dataset into public and catholic school subsets, transforming object types into floats where needed by removing percentage and transforming to decimal places. Saving public and catholic subsets as separate csv files
Elem Public Code Linear Reg - Public school set - completing exploratory data reports on dataset, checking distribution of independent and dependent variables, checking correlation of variables. Created a linear regression model for public school dataset and produced R2 values for groups and combined input variables
Public_RF - Public school set - using random forest regression model with combined variable groups with all 6 outcome variables.

Tentative Stages:
Moving forwards, I plan to continue to explore the Random Forest Regression with seprarate groups of variables as i had done with my linear regression model. I would like to continue to create a time series model using past years versions of my dataset
to explore the change of my results over time. 
I omitted using variables regarding special education services in my initial models, however i am interested in seeing how those may affect my models if included
Another element i  hope to explore is using location grouped with percentage of school aged children living in low income housing as a potential variable in my models as well. I think this could be useful as there are many elements which play a role in the education of children and hope to explore as many as I am able to. 
To complete this i would need to the schools by district or postal code matched with the percentage of school aged children living in low income housing.
The final stages of this project would be to create visualizations for my models and identify the most significant findings. As of yet i have found that my models have produced lower than expected R^2 results, however i am not surprised as there are many external factors, including teaching and school budgets not featured in my dataset, however I do believe that my findings can be valuable to discussing the impact of demographics on EQAO results, especially for students in Grade 6
